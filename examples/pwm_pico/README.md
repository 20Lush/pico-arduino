The Pico PMW functionality is rather complicated to use. I provide some easy to use PWM class.

To test the functionality I demonstrate our PicoPWM class which allows you define the frequency and the value range.

## Connections 
To test it we connect an external LED via a resistor at the signal end:

| PWM      | Pico              
|----------|-----------
|  -       | GND 
|  Signal  | GP15
