# Logic Analyzer

We can use the Pico as a logical analyzer capturing device together with [Sigrok Pulseview](https://sigrok.org/wiki/PulseView).

The CMakeLists.txt just installs the [logic-analyzer project](https://github.com/pschatzmann/logic-analyzer). 

The generated uf2 files can be found in the ./build/bin/examples/ subdirectories.
