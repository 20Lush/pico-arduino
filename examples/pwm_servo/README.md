The Pico PMW functionality is rather complicated to use. I provide some easy to use PWM classes and on on top of this I have implemented the Arduino Servo API which I demonstrate the sweep example which I have taken from the [Servo library](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Servo).  

To test the functionality I was using a small GH-S37A servo.
