#Mozzi on a Raspberry Pico

I spent some offort to provide Pico Support for the [Mozzi Project](https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/).

Currently your Arduino can only beep like a microwave oven. Mozzi brings your Arduino to life by allowing it to produce much more complex and interesting growls, sweeps and chorusing atmospherics. These sounds can be quickly and easily constructed from familiar synthesis units like oscillators, delays, filters and envelopes.
